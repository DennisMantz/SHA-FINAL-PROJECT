# SyncBRO - Final class project (Duration: 20 days)

## Purpose
This application allows users to create customizable CV-like cards, via "ShareBro", that can be used as an online business card, as a one-link CV displaying contact information and links for platforms and projects, or just to have a card ready to share all your socials with friends! You can copy the link with one button and share each card, or just tap on the QR code and have others scan it!

Additionally, users can create custom bookmark groups (Workspaces) to set up different work environments and open them easily.
